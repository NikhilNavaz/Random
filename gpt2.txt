Intelligence amplification (I.A.) is a multidisciplinary field whose goal is to automate activities that
presently require human intelligence. Recent successes in A.I. include computerized medical diagnosticians and
systems that automatically customize hardware to particular user requirement. Perception is concerned with
building model of the physical world from sensory input (visual, audio, etc.). Many important technical concepts
have arisen from A.I. that unify these diverse problem areas and that from the foundation of the scientific
discipline.
Keywords: Machine learning, Deep learning, Big data, Emotions Recognition.
I. Introduction
Intelligence amplification (IA) refers to the effective use of Information technology in augmenting
human intelligence. The idea was first proposed in the 1950s and 1960s by cybernetics and early computer
pioneers. The ability to learn from experience and apply in future action is called intelligence, and when we
impart this intelligence into a machine is known as Intelligence amplification. IA is sometimes contrasted with
AI (artificial intelligence), that is, the project of building a human - like Intelligence in the form of an
autonomous technological system such as a Computer or Robot. AI has encountered many fundamental
obstacles, practical as well as theoretical, which for AI seem moot, as it needs technology merely as an extra
support for an autonomous intelligence that has already proven to function.
“I think it‟s likely that with technology we can in the fairly near future create or become creature of
more than human intelligence. Such a technological singularity would revolutionize our world”.
II. Key Terms Of Intelligence Amplification
The terms “intelligence augmentation” and “intelligence amplification” evoke images of human beings
with computer chips embedded in their skulls or bizarre accoutrements attached to their heads.
 IA does not need to understand the human brain except for extreme enhancement. It can be a user interface
issue.
 Gradual acclimatisation
 Effective intelligence might be more relevant than “real” intelligence

III. Technolgogy
Intelligence Amplification uses variety of technology to build best:
 Natural language Generation (NLG)
NLG is a sub-discipline of Intelligence Amplification (IA) that convert all types of data into human-readable
text. This software converts data into text at a rapid pace, enabling machines to communicate effectively.

 Speech recognition
Siri is just one of the systems that can understand you. Every day, more and more systems are created that can
transcribe human language, reaching hundreds of thousands through voice-response interactive systems and
mobile apps.
 Virtual Agents
A virtual agent is nothing more than a computer agent or program capable of interacting with humans.
 IA-Optimized Hardware
IA technology makes hardware much friendlier. How? Through new graphics and central processing units and
processing devices specifically designed and structured to execute IA-oriented tasks.
 Deep Learning Platforms
Deep learning platforms use a unique form of ML that involves artificial neural circuits with various abstraction
layers that can mimic the human brain, processing data and creating patterns for decision making.
 Emotion Recognition
This technology allows software to “read” the emotions on a human face using advanced image processing or
audio data processing. We are now at the point where we can capture “micro-expressions,” or subtle body
language cues, and vocal intonation that betrays a person‟s feelings.

IV. Application
IA is important because it can help solve immensely difficult issues in various industries, such as
entertainment, education, health, commerce, transport and utilities. IA applications can be grouped into four
categories:
 Reasoning: The ability to solve problems through logical deduction. E.g. financial assets management,
legal assessment, financial application processing, autonomous weapons system, games
 Knowledge: The ability to present knowledge about the world. E.g. purchase prediction, fraud prevention,
drug creation
 Communication: The ability to understand spoken and written language. E.g. real-time translation of
spoken and written languages, real-time transcription, intelligent assistants, voice control
 Perception: The ability to infer things about the world via sounds, image, and other sensory inputs. E.g.
medical diagnosis, autonomous vehicles, surveillance
IA trends in various sectors:
I. Healthcare
 Medecision developed an algorithm that detects 8 variables in diabetes patients to determine if
hospitalization is required.
 An app called BiliScreen utilizes a smartphone camera, ML tools, and computer vision algorithms to detect
increased levels of bilirubin in the patient‟s eye.

II. Automotive industry
 Tesla introduced TeslaBot, an intelligent virtual assistant integrated with Tesla models S and X, allows
users to interact with their car from their phone or desktop.
 Uber AI Labs is working on developing self-driven cars. Uber has already tested a batch of self-driving cars
in 2016.
 Nvidia has partnered with Volkswagen to develop “intelligent co-pilot systems” in cars that will enable
safety warnings, gesture control, and voice and facial recognition.
 Ericsson predicts that 5G technology will improve vehicle-to-vehicle communication wherein sensors will
be implanted in airport runways, railways, and roads.
V. Algorithms
Intelligence Amplification is the study of building agents that act rationally. Most of the time, these
agents perform some kind of search algorithm in the background in order to achieve their tasks. There are far
too many powerful search algorithms out there to fit in a single article. Instead, this article will discuss six of the
fundamental search algorithms, divided into two categories, as shown below.
Figure 3: Classification of search algorithm
 Uninformed Search Algorithms
The plans to reach the goal state from the start state differ only by the order and/or length of actions.
Uninformed search is also called Blind search.
Depth First Search
Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm
starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far
as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Breadth First Search
Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the
tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a „search key‟), and explores all of the
neighbour nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
 Informed Search Algorithms
The algorithms have information on the goal state, which helps in more efficient searching.
Greedy Search
In greedy search, we expand the node closest to the goal node. The “closeness” is estimated by a heuristic h(x) .
Heuristic: A heuristic h is defined as- h(x) = Estimate of distance of node x from the goal node. Lower the value
of h(x), closer is the node from the goal.
A* Tree Search
A* Tree Search, or simply known as A* Search, combines the strengths of uniform-cost search and greedy
search.

VI. Advantages
 IA would have a low error rate compared to humans, if coded properly. They would have incredible
precision, accuracy, and speed
 Replace humans in repetitive, tedious tasks and in many laborious places of work
 Robotic pets can interact with humans. Can help in depression and inactivity
 They don't need to sleep, rest, take breaks, or get entertained, as they don't get bored or tired
VII. Disadvantags
 Can cost a lot of money and time to build, rebuild, and repair. Robotic repair can occur to reduce time and
humans needing to fix it, but that'll cost more money and resources
 IA as robots can supercede humans, enslaving us
 As seen partially with smartphones and other technology already, humans can become too dependent on AI
and lose their mental capacities
 Machines can easily lead to destruction, if put in the wrong hands. That is, at least a fear of many humans
VIII. Conclusion
The goal of Intelligence amplification is to deliver a symbolic between man and machine. Large
amount of data can sometimes solve problems that sophisticated tools cannot. There is significance resistance to
the entry of computers to new lines of work, such as medicine, but the next generation will not know of a world
without computers.
